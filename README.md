Social Events Help

This platform is for different NGOs and users who are willing to become Volunteers. 
The Ngo can add different events where they need help. 
These events are visible in the volunteer's profile where the user can register in for any number of events.

There is no support for django on IBM cloud. Could not find appropriate boilerplate for django.
